## Features

Software licensing provides merchants with license key generation, activation, extension, and checking systems. 

It allows you to automatically issue license keys, set a hardware ID for them, and actively check any time you want across your customer purchases. It can be integrated with any type of software you’re selling to ensure that the end consumer has actually paid for it.
