## Features

Software licensing provides merchants with license key generation, activation, extension, and checking systems. 

It allows you to automatically issue license keys, set a hardware ID for them, and actively check any time you want across your customer purchases. It can be integrated with any type of software youâ€™re selling to ensure that the end consumer has actually paid for it.
